Chevereto Free
=
Chevereto is a web application that allows the creation of image hosting websites. The first public release was in early 2009 ([archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/chevereto/)) and the current major version is V3. This repo here is Chevereto Free, which is a fork of Chevereto V3 in which only the most essential features are preserved and it is released as Open Source software.

Chevereto Free has the same look and feel of the [paid version](https://chevereto.com). Most likely it will fit all your personal needs. The features removed in this fork are those business-oriented like external storage servers or banner management to name a few.

Chevereto was created and still mainteined by just one person: [Rodolfo Berrios](https://github.com/rodolfoberrios).

### Building the next-gen Chevereto
Chevereto is being modernized by introducing new coding standards and turning towards a common Open Source base release which you will be able to add plugins and modifications. [Learn more](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/building-the-next-gen-chevereto.11140/).

### Chevereto Free vs Chevereto (paid)
The paid version includes all features, it gets frequent updates, and it is always up to six months ahead of the free edition. The table below shows the distinctions between both versions.
